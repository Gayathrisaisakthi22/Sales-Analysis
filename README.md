### Data Analysis
-- KPIâ€™s

-- Average Pizzas Per Order
``` sql
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2))
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales
```

-- Daily Trend for Total Orders
``` sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date)
```

-- Sales by Pizza Category
``` sql
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
